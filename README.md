### Security

#### Threat Model

zfleak is designed to keep project secrets out of the wrong places:

- plain config files on disk should not be the default store for production secrets
- sensitive projects should not be loaded into the parent shell
- secret values should not be printed unless the user explicitly asks for them

#### What Each Phase Protects

- Phase 1 hardens local file handling and masks `zfleak show` output by default.
- Phase 2 blocks sensitive projects from `use-project` and gates `show --reveal`.
- Phase 3 adds secret backends so configs can reference secrets by name.
- Phase 4 stores secrets in macOS Keychain, `pass`, or encrypted files.
- Phase 5 adds `zfleak run` so secrets live only in a child process.
- Phase 6 documents the security model and migration path.

#### Backend Setup

zfleak resolves a vault backend automatically when `ZFLEAK_VAULT_BACKEND` is unset:

- macOS: `keychain`
- Linux or other Unix-like systems with `pass` installed: `pass`
- fallback: encrypted file backend

You can check the resolved backend with:

```bash
zfleak vault-backend
```

You can also force a backend for a single command:

```bash
zfleak --backend file run demo -- env | grep DEMO_SECRET
```

#### Secret References

Use backend references in project configs instead of raw production secrets:

```bash
# zfleak:secret DB_PASSWORD=demo/DB_PASSWORD
```

That keeps the config readable while storing the secret value in the selected backend.

#### Migrating From Plaintext

If a project already stores secrets as `export` lines, migrate them into a backend:

```bash
zfleak migrate demo --to-backend file
```

The command rewrites secret `export` lines into `# zfleak:secret VAR=<project>/VAR` references and stores the values in the chosen backend.

For production projects, add:

```bash
export ZFLEAK_SENSITIVE=true
```

That blocks direct shell loading and keeps the project on the `zfleak run` path.

### Installation

#### Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/74WebWorks/Zfleak/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Manual Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/74WebWorks/Zfleak.git ~/.zfleak-install
   ```

2. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.zfleak-install
   ./install.sh
   ```
   
   The installer automatically detects your shell (Bash or Zsh) and configures the appropriate files.

3. Reload your shell:
   ```bash
   # For Zsh
   source ~/.zshrc
   
   # For Bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.bash_profile on macOS
   ```

### Basic Usage

#### Creating Projects

```bash
# Create a new project
zfleak new-project <name> [path]

# Example
zfleak new-project backend ~/work/mycompany/backend
```

This creates a configuration file with a template containing common environment variables.

#### Automatic Loading

Once a project is created and a path is registered, simply navigate to that directory:

```bash
cd ~/work/mycompany/backend
# 🔍 Detected project: backend
# ✅ Loaded active project: backend
```

#### Manual Switching

```bash
# Switch to a project
use-project backend

# View current project
current-project

# Clear environment
clear-project
```

### Commands

#### `zfleak new-project <name> [path]`

Create a new project configuration with optional auto-detection path.

**Examples:**
```bash
zfleak new-project webapp ~/projects/webapp
zfleak new-project api  # No auto-detection
```

#### `zfleak register-path <name> <path>`

Register or update the auto-detection path for an existing project.

**Example:**
```bash
zfleak register-path api ~/projects/api
```

#### `zfleak list`

List all projects (active and archived).

**Example output:**
```
Active Projects:

  • backend → /Users/you/work/backend
  • frontend → /Users/you/work/frontend
  • api (no auto-detection path)

Archived Projects:

  • old-project
```

#### `zfleak edit <name>`

Open a project's configuration in your editor.

**Example:**
```bash
zfleak edit backend
```

#### `zfleak show <name>`

Display a project's configuration.

**Example:**
```bash
zfleak show backend
```

#### `zfleak archive <name>`

Move a project to the archive (keeps config but removes from active list).

**Example:**
```bash
zfleak archive old-project
```

#### `zfleak restore <name>`

Restore an archived project to active status.

**Example:**
```bash
zfleak restore old-project
```

### Configuration

#### Project Configuration Files

Project configs are stored in `~/.zfleak.d/<project-name>.zsh`.

**Example configuration:**

```bash
# ~/.zfleak.d/backend.zsh
export FLASK_APP='backend.app:create_app()'
export FLASK_ENV=development

export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_USER=backend_user
export DB_PASSWORD=dev_password
export DB_NAME=backend_dev

export API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export DEBUG=true
```

#### Path Registration

Paths are registered in `~/.zfleak.d/projects.conf`:

```
backend:/Users/you/work/backend
frontend:/Users/you/work/frontend
api:/Users/you/work/api
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: Flask Application

```bash
# Create project
zfleak new-project myflask ~/projects/myflask

# Edit configuration
zfleak edit myflask

# Add these lines:
# export FLASK_APP='myflask.app:create_app()'
# export FLASK_ENV=development
# export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/myflask

# Use it
cd ~/projects/myflask
flask run  # Uses your configured environment!
```

#### Example 2: Multiple Environments

```bash
# Create different environments for same project
zfleak new-project api-dev ~/projects/api
zfleak new-project api-staging
zfleak new-project api-prod

# Configure each differently
zfleak edit api-dev       # Add dev database
zfleak edit api-staging   # Add staging database
zfleak edit api-prod      # Add prod database

# Switch between them
use-project api-dev
use-project api-staging
use-project api-prod
```

#### Example 3: Team Configuration

```bash
# Share your zfleak config with your team
cd ~/.zfleak.d
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Team zfleak configuration"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourteam/zfleak-config.git
git push -u origin main

# Team members install:
git clone https://github.com/yourteam/zfleak-config.git ~/.zfleak.d
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Advanced Features

#### Custom Configuration Directory

Set a custom location for zfleak configs:

```bash
export ZFLEAK_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/my-custom-location"
```

#### Integration with Other Tools

```bash
# Use with Docker
docker run -e "$(env | grep DB_)" myimage

# Use with Make
make deploy DB_HOST=$DB_HOST DB_NAME=$DB_NAME

# Export to .env file
env | grep "^DB_\|^API_" > .env
```

#### Variable Tracking

zfleak tracks which variables it loads and automatically unsets them when switching projects:

```bash
use-project project-a  # Sets project-a variables
use-project project-b  # Unsets project-a vars, sets project-b vars
clear-project          # Unsets all project vars
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Global Settings

Create `~/.zfleak.d/common.zsh` for settings shared across all projects:

```bash
# Common settings for all projects
export EDITOR=code
export DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Machine-Specific Settings

Create `~/.zfleak.local` for settings that shouldn't be in version control:

```bash
# Machine-specific secrets
export SECRET_API_KEY=abc123
export LOCAL_DEV_PATH=/custom/path
```
